##Traffic Signal Control System

This project implements an intelligent traffic signal control system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system detects vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection, analyzes traffic patterns in real-time, and dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to optimize traffic flow and ensure pedestrian safety.

##Key Features:
  Vehicle Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to detect vehicles approaching the intersection.
  
  Pedestrian Detection: Detects pedestrians and responds accordingly by adjusting signal timings to facilitate safe pedestrian crossings.
  
  Dynamic Signal Control: Analyzes traffic density and dynamically adjusts signal timings to minimize congestion and reduce waiting times.
  
  Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of traffic conditions and signal states for efficient management and control.
  
  Scalability: Designed to be scalable and adaptable to different intersection configurations and traffic scenarios.
  
  User-friendly Interface: Includes an intuitive interface for configuration and monitoring, making it accessible to traffic engineers and administrators.
  
##Technologies Used:
  Computer Vision: Utilizes computer vision techniques for vehicle and pedestrian detection.
  
  Machine Learning: Implements machine learning algorithms for object detection and traffic pattern analysis.
  
  Python: Developed primarily in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.
  
  GitHub: Hosted on GitHub for version control, collaboration, and community engagement.
  
##Usage:
  Installation: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
  
  Configuration: Customize the system settings and parameters according to your specific traffic intersection setup.
  
  Execution: Run the main script to start the traffic signal control system.
  
  Monitoring: Access the real-time monitoring interface to observe traffic conditions and signal states.
