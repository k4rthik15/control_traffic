# control_traffic
This project implements an intelligent traffic signal control system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system detects vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection, analyzes traffic patterns in real-time, and dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to optimize traffic flow and ensure pedestrian safety.
